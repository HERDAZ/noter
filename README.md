# NOTER
Small bash program that (badly) manages journals, with a little integration with 'doing', an even smaller wrapper around 'echo TEXT > file'.

## Install
Place it in a new empty directory, that is pointed to by ```$NOTERDIR```, and create an alias for it, as leaving it in /usr/bin or else will polute it with new journals, then call
```
$noter help
```
to know more. Feel free to open an issue if you are having problem with it :)

## Participating
Their are some things that I had the idea of, but haven't coded, writen in TODOs around the file. Feel free to make pull request if you want to participate.
